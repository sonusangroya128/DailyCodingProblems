/**
 * Problem: Find duplicate element based on pigeon hole principle.
 * Approach: The elements in the array is from 0 to n-1 and all of them are positive.
 *           There is a catch, the array is of length n and the elements are from 0 to n-1 (n elements).
 *           The array can be used as a HashMap.
 * Algorithm: Traverse the array. For every element,take its abs value & if abs(array[i])‘th element is positive,
 *            the element has not encountered before, else if negative element has been encountered before, print abs value of current element.
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
