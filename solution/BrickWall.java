/**
 * Problem: BrickWall. LC: 554.
 *    A wall consists of several rows of bricks of various integer lengths and uniform height.
 *    Your goal is to find a vertical line going from the top to the bottom of the wall that cuts through the fewest number of bricks.
 *    If the line goes through the edge between two bricks, this does not count as a cut.
 * Approach: If the goal here is to find where a line will cross the fewest bricks, then we could also say that the goal is to find where the most brick edges line up.
 *    We can consider the edges to occur at an index representing the current running total of the previous elements of a given row of the wall.
 *    For example, if the row is defined as [1,2,2,1], then the inside edges occur at [1,1+2,1+2+2], or [1,3,5].
 *    If we now know how to find edges, then we're left with finding out which index has highest frequency of edges, which naturally calls for a frequency map.
 *    So we can iterate through each row in the wall, keep a running total of the current row (rowSum), and then update frequency of each edge's index in our frequency map (freq).
 *    Once we're done filling freq, we just need to iterate through it to find highest value (best), which represents number of edges aligned on a single index.
 *    Our actual answer, however, is number of bricks, not edges, so we should return the total number of rows minus best.
 *    It's faster to keep track of best as we add values to freq.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(mn)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
