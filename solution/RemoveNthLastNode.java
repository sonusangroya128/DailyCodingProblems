/**
 * Problem: Delete Nth node from the end of the given linked list
 *
 * Approach: Take two pointers, first will point to the head of the linked list and second will point to the Nth node from the beginning.
 * Now keep increment both the pointers by one at the same time until second is pointing to the last node of the linked list.
 * After the operations from the previous step, first pointer should be pointing to the Nth node from the end by now.
 * So, delete the node first pointer is pointing to.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
