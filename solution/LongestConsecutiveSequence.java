/**
 * Problem: Given unsorted integer array, find length of longest consecutive elements sequence.
 * Approach: 1.HashSet and Intelligent Sequence Building:
               Numbers are stored in a HashSet to allow O(1) lookups, and we only attempt to build sequences from numbers that are not already part of a longer sequence.
               This is accomplished by first ensuring that number that would immediately precede the current number in a sequence is not present, as that number would necessarily be part of a longer sequence.
             2.Sort and Iterate
