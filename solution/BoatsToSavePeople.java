/**
 * Problem: LC.881. Min Boats Required to Save People. At most two people can fit in a rescue boat.
 * Approach: Sort people. For the current heaviest person, we try to let him go with the lightest person.
 *           As all people need to get on the boat. If the sum of weight is over the limit, we have to let the heaviest go alone.
 *           No one can take the same boat with him. At the end of for loop, it may happen that i = j.
 *           But it won't change the result so don't worry about it.
 * Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
