/**
 * Problem: Given an array representing heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west.
 *          The city assessor would like us to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value street.
 *          For example, given array [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], we should return 3, since the top floors of the buildings with heights 8, 6, and 1 all have an unobstructed view to the west.
 * Approach: Slide from last to first and track the number of buildings.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
