/**
 * Problem: A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in diagram below).
 *  The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *  The robot is trying to reach bottom-right corner of grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
 *  How many possible unique paths are there when obstacles are present?
 *
 * Approach: Use recurrence function
 *           No. of ways to reach cell[i][j] = cell[i-1][j] + cell[i][j-1]
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(mn)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
